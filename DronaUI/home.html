<p>In Safari advanced settings I have 14MB of website data.  
Some entries have a large amount of data such as mail.google.com with 4.3 MB. 
 Google Mail in Safari is web based and I have no offline content except 1 small unread message in my inbox.  My contacts are not available when wifi or mobile is not connected so what is the "Webdata" and what would I delete if I deleted it?
